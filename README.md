# Green House Project

An automatic greenhouse that can:  
- Water the tomato plants
- Detect ripe tomatoes

This is done by constructing a frame on which a 2d gantry is mounted to move a camera, this camera is controlled by a Raspberry pi.
The irigation system allows for each plant to receive water when the average moisture (measured by the sensors) is below a threshold. 
The irigation system is controlled by a arduino.
The frame fits 3 plants.

# Check each branch for specific part of the greenhouse
