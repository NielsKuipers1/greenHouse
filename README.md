# Green House Project

An automatic greenhouse that can:  
- Water the tomato plants
- Detect ripe tomatoes
- Cut ripe tomatoes

This is done by constructing a frame on which a 2d gantry is mounted to move the camera, cutter and basket.  
Each plant has its own watering system, which will be controlled by moisture sensors in the soil.  
The frame fits 3 plants.
